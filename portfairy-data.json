Hell Ship is a tale of hardship and heroism; of survival and love.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1852, the emigrant clipper Ticonderoga limped through the heads of Melbourne’s Port Phillip Bay after a three-month voyage from Liverpool. By the time she reached Australia, she was a floating catastrophe. Shortly after crossing the equator, typhus had erupted throughout her decks, and in just a few weeks, one hundred of her mainly Highland Scots emigrants had perished, hastily buried at sea with what little ceremony could be afforded. Schools of sharks, it was said, had stalked Ticonderoga’s progress across the oceans. \r\n\r\nForbidden to enter Melbourne, the Ticonderoga was made to offload her human cargo onto a small beach inside the heads where, for the next six weeks, a makeshift quarantine hospital was established. Through the tireless efforts of the ship’s young surgeon, aided by a handful of passengers, including a courageous young Scots woman from the Isle of Mull, many lives were saved, which went on to establish Australian families which thrive to this day. In a subsequent enquiry into the disaster, the young surgeon emerged as the hero of the Ticonderoga story, was briefly feted, then disappeared into a quiet life as a country doctor. As these stories sometimes go, he married the young nurse, and the two lived a long and happy life.\r\n\r\nThey were also Michael Veitch’s Great-great grandparents, James William Henry Veitch and Annie Morrison.

Featuring Anthony Field, Emma Watkins and Lachlan Gillespie from The Wiggles alongside Oliver Brian and David O’Reilly, The Unusual Commoners play the music of The Clancy Brothers, The Pogues, The Corries, Neil Diamond, John Williamson, John Denver and traditional folk music. From sold out gigs in Newfoundland playing alongside Alan Doyle to playing gigs across Australia raising money for Soldier On, The Unusual Commoners are thrilled to playing for you here at Port Fairy Folk Festival. \r\n","url":"https://www.portfairyfolkfestival.com/unusual-commoners/","twitter":"","country":"AUS","image_name":"theunusualcommoners","musician":1},{"id":314,"name":"Things Of Stone \u0026 Wood","bio":"Thirty years ago a rag-tag bunch of folkies got together and formed a band called Things of Stone \u0026 Wood that went on to define Melbourne in the early 1990s. Off the back of their top 10 single Happy Birthday Helen, the band achieved national success, international tours, a gold album The Yearning and even a Late Show television parody, kicking off a career that would place them as one of Australia's most loved folk-rock bands. The group’s imaginative use of organic instruments set off an acoustic/folk movement that paved the way for the likes of John Butler, The Waifs and Angus \u0026 Julia Stone. Their live performances have always been full of energy and passion and whilst they've won many an industry award, it’s on stage that demonstrates why they're so loved. The band return to Port Fairy for their 30th anniversary tour launching their first album in over a decade.  \r\n","url":"https://www.portfairyfolkfestival.com/things-of-stone-wood/","twitter":"","country":"AUS","image_name":"thingsofstonewood","musician":1},{"id":315,"name":"This Way North","bio":"It’s easy to forget that This Way North is a two-piece band.
